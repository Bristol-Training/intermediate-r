The easiest way to get access to R and RStudio is first downloading and installing the **latest R version** from [https://cran.rstudio.com/](https://cran.rstudio.com/), and after downloading and installing **RStudio** from [https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).
