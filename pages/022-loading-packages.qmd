## Using a package

You can use a package in your script via the `library` command. To use
`stringr` you should type;

```r
library(stringr)
```

into the console. When you press return, nothing should happen. If you see
output similar to;

```
Error in library(stringr) : there is no package called ‘stringr’
```

then this means that `stringr` is not installed properly.

To get help on a package type `?` before its name, e.g.

```r
?stringr
```

All of the functions in `stringr` start with `str_` and take 
a string (or vector/list of strings) as the first argument.

Key functions are;

* `str_c` : Modern replacement for `cat`
* `str_length` : Count the number of characters in a string
* `str_sub` : Extract substrings
* `str_trim` : Remove trailing and leading whitespace
* `str_pad` : Pad a string
* `str_wrap` : Wrap a string into a paragraph
