title: Using packages
---


Once installed, packages are loaded into the R environment using the function `library()`. For example, to use `stringr` you should type:

```{r}
library(stringr)
```

If you see output similar to;

```
Error in library(stringr) : there is no package called ‘stringr’
```

then this means that `stringr` is not installed properly. Try installing it again with `install.packages("stringr")`.

To get help on a package type `?` followed by its name, e.g.

```r
?stringr
```

You can also look for the *vignette* documentation and examples typing

```r
vignette("stringr")
```
