title: Tidyverse
---


As mentioned before, R is an old programming language that was written
as a re-implementation of the even older language, S. Over the years
this has meant that R has gained many different layers and methods
of doing things. This has created lots of inconsistencies and cruft, 
with R sometimes behaving in strange and unexpected ways that can be 
confusing for new users, and not suited to applications in 
modern data science.

The tidyverse is a coherent collection of modern R packages that
solves this problem. It is a coherent system of packages for data manipulation, 
exploration and visualization that share a common design philosophy.
The packages were originally mostly developed by Hadley Wickham,
but have been expanded by several contributers and has now developed
into a thriving and highly supportive community.

Modern R is the tidyverse, and I strongly recommend that you use
the tidyverse when you use R for data science, manipulation and
visualisation.

There is lots of information about the tidyverse on the web, e.g.

* [What is the tidyverse?](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)
* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz) - an online book by 
Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham that teaches the concepts of 
tidy data and shows how R with the tidyverse will help you create
tidy data workflows.

## Loading the tidyverse

You can install and use the tidyverse by typing;

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)
```

This will download and then import the tidyverse modules. You should
see something similar to this printed;

```
── Attaching packages ────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ──
✓ ggplot2 3.3.2     ✓ purrr   0.3.4
✓ tibble  3.0.3     ✓ dplyr   1.0.2
✓ tidyr   1.1.2     ✓ forcats 0.5.0
✓ readr   1.3.1     
── Conflicts ───────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──
x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()
x dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()
```

This shows that the seven core tidyverse modules have been loaded
([ggplot2](https://ggplot2-book.org), [tibble](https://tibble.tidyverse.org),
[tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org), [readr](https://readr.tidyverse.org),
[purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org), [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org)
and [forcats](https://forcats.tidyverse.org)).

It also shows how the modern `dplyr::filter` and `dplyr::lag`
functions replace the older `stats::filter` and 
`stats::lag` functions.
