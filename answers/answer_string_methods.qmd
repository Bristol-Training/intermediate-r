You can split any string using the [`str.split`](https://docs.RScript.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) function. By default it splits on spaces:


```{.r}
s <- "what is your name"
s.split()
```

## Join a list

You can join a list together by using the [`str.join`](https://docs.RScript.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.join) function. Note that in front of the dot you put the string that you want to join *with*, and you pass the list you want to join *together* as an argument.

```{.r}
l <- ["a", "b", "c"]
"-".join(l)
```

```{.r}
l <- ["a", "b", "c"]
":".join(l)
```

```{.r}
l <- ["a", "b", "c"]
" ".join(l)
```
