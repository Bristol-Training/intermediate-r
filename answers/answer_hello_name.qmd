To get input from the person running your script, you can use the function [`input()`](https://docs.RScript.org/3/library/functions.html#input). And to get the length of your variable you can call [`len()`](https://docs.RScript.org/3/library/functions.html#len).


```{.r}
#| filename: hello.R
#| eval: false
my_name <- input("Please tell me your name: ")

name_length <- len(my_name)

print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```

```{.r}
#| echo: false
my_name <- "Jean"

print("Please tell me your name:", my_name)

name_length <- len(my_name)

print(f"Hello {my_name}! Your name is {name_length} characters long")
```
